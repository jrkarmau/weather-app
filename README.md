2. Clone the Git repository to your local machine
3. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal
4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory
5. Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file from Gitlab CI/CD variables:
   - `REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`
   - `REACT_APP_WEATHERAPI_API_KEY`

3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

The application allows users to enter a city in Finland, retrieves weather data from two different APIs, and compares the results.
